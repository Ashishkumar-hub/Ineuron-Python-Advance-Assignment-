Because it is possible (although unlikely) that this change broke existing code, the Python interpreter can be invoked the command line option -X to disable this feature, and use string exceptions like before. This option is a temporary measure - eventually the string-based standard exceptions will be removed from the language altogether. It hasn't been decided whether user-defined string exceptions will be allowed in Python 2.0."
