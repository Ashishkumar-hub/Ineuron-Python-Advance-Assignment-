Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. Hence when we have to extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning we can use operator overloading,"
